# 🎬 Movie App
## Why I Created This 🤔
 Was tired of the ads, so I decided to create my own app :)
## 📌 Overview
Welcome to **Movie App**, a SwiftUI-based application that allows users to **search for movies**, **view details**, and **stream them directly**. Powered by **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** and **Videasy Player**, this app provides a seamless movie-watching experience.



## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Search Movies** – Find movies instantly using TMDb API.
- 🎥 **Movie Details** – View posters, release dates, ratings, and overviews.
- ▶️ **Stream Movies** – Tap on a movie to watch it directly via Videasy Player.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Support** – Enjoy a sleek UI optimized for all themes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SwiftUI** – Modern UI framework.
- **Combine** – For handling asynchronous API calls.
- **TMDb API** – Fetches movie data.
- **Videasy Player** – Embedded video player for streaming.
- **WKWebView** – Renders the Videasy player inside the app.

## 🔧 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shubhamnda/Movie-App.git
   cd movie-app
   ```
2. **Open in Xcode** and build the project.
3. **Run the app** on a simulator or device.

## 🔑 API Configuration
To fetch movies, you need a **TMDb API Key**:
1. Get an API Key from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Add it to your Swift code:
   ```swift
   let apiKey = "YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"
   ```
